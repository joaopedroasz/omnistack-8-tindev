# Tindev
A project from semana omnistack 8.

## Introducion ##
This project aims to participate the semana omnistack, which took place from the 4th to the 11th of July.
The semana omnistack is a programming event that aims to teach the JavaScript stack (NodeJS, ReactJS and React Native) to everyone, using a practical teaching methodology. That week Tindev was developed, a system in which programmers can meet, like and dislike other programmers.

## Yarn ##
